## Introduction

Fountains, as beautiful and engaging public installations, play a significant role in the entertainment and tourism industry. The "Digital Fountain" project aims to enhance the functionality of traditional fountains using IoT technology, creating an interactive, adaptive, and efficient attraction.

### Background and Motivation:

Fountains are not just water features but are centers for community engagement, cultural showcases, and provide therapeutic effects. To maximize these benefits, we aim to address the challenges of manual fountain control, which is labor-intensive, inconsistent, and lacks responsiveness.

### Problem Definition:

Our project proposes a smart fountain that uses sensor data (Image, Sound, and Light) to adapt its behavior dynamically. The goal is to automate the fountainâ€™s responses to crowd density, ambient light, and sound levels, reducing manual oversight and increasing efficiency and engagement.

## System Overview:

Our solution involves developing a Fountain Control Model that responds dynamically to real-time sensor data.

### Sensors Used:

- **Image Sensor:** For crowd monitoring and management.
- **Light Sensor:** To adjust lighting based on ambient conditions.
- **Noise Sensor/Microphone:** To modulate music volume according to ambient noise levels.

### Combining sensor data:

The data from these sensors are used in unison to adjust the fountain's water flow, lighting, and music in real time.

## Methodology:

### Application Implementation:

The project includes an Android application designed to collect and upload various types of sensor data to a Firebase database for analysis and decision-making.

### Proposed algorithms/methods:

Our approach involves preprocessing the sensor data, creating a dataset, and then using a decision tree model to predict the fountain's status. The model's predictions guide the fountain's light, sound, and water display configurations.

## Features:

- **Light Level Measurement:** Using the device's light sensor.
- **Sound Level Measurement:** Utilizing the device's microphone.
- **Image Capture:** Allowing users to take pictures.
- **Data Upload:** Uploading sensor data to Firebase Firestore in real-time.
- **Dynamic Data Collection:** Providing users control over data collection.
